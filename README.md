# PHP Unset() and References: Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle but important issue in PHP related to the `unset()` function and references.  When you use `unset()` on a variable that's referenced elsewhere, the reference might continue to hold the old value, potentially causing unexpected results in your code.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic behavior.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a solution to address this issue.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.php` using a PHP interpreter.
3. Observe the output, which might be different from your expectations.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing references when using `unset()`.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version of the code demonstrating how to avoid this issue.
