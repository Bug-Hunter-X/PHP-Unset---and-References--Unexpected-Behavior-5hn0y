This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to unset() and references.  When using unset() on a variable that's referenced elsewhere, the reference might still retain the old value, leading to unexpected behavior.

```php
<?php
$array = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$ref = &$array['a'];
unset($array['a']);
echo '$ref: ' . $ref . '\n'; // Outputs 1, even though unset() was called
echo '$array: ' . print_r($array, true) . '\n'; // Outputs Array ( [b] => 2 )
?>
```
